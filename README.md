The AIffice is a multi-agent AI team designed to build product MVPs from a single prompt.

This was developed as an experiment to understand the ongoing abilities of LLMs as developers and writers.

Using CrewAI, I build a mult-agent team of a Project Manager, Designer, Front End Deveolper, Back End Developer to take prompts and return functional apps or games.
I also wanted to test scriptwriting abilities, so I had a scriptwriter give personalities to each team member, and create a dialogue around the build process.

As a result, with a signle prompt, you receive a product, and a detailed log of employee interactions throughout the build process.
I turned one of these projects into a short comedy episode. You can watch it here: [The AIffice: Ep 1 - Testimonial Tribulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3ow4yhuXDQ&t=1s)

I plan on continually testing these abilities as LLMs improve across multiple areas (multi-agent workflows, personaility based comedy writing, voice generation, and image model consistency).

This is a personal project, and has not been optimized for public use. Although still runnable through any of the the_aiffice.py files, it should be updated to use newer CrewAI standards and documentation.
